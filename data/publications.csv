In addition, we notice strong shifts in sentiment and emotions across the cultures.

We explore the degree to which we can employ computational models to infer people's values from the text that they write and the everyday activities that they perform. In addition to investigating how personal values are expressed in language, we use natural language processing methods to automatically discover relationships between a person's values, behaviors, and cultural background. To this end, we show that the automatic analysis of less constrained, open-ended essay questions leads to a model of personal values that is more strongly connected to behaviors than traditional forced-choice value surveys, and that cultural background has a significant influence these connections. To help measure personal values in textual data, we use a novel crowd-powered sorting algorithm to construct a hierarchical lexicon of words and phrases related to human values. Additionally, we develop semantic representations of human activities that capture a variety of useful dimensions such the motivation for which they are typically done. We leverage these representations to build deep neural models that are able to make predictions about a person's activities based on their observed linguistic patterns and inferred values.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

We design novel graph-based features for supervised and unsupervised keyword extraction from emails, and use the resulting system with success to uncover patterns in a new dataset -- student statements of purpose. Furthermore, the system is used with new features on the problem of usage expression extraction from product reviews, where we obtain interesting insights. The system while used on student discussions, uncover new and exciting patterns. While each of the above problems is conceptually distinct, they share two key common elements -- keywords and social data. Social data can be messy, hard-to-interpret, and not easily amenable to existing NLP resources.

Seeking to improve the understanding of counseling practice, researchers have started to explore Natural Language Processing approaches to analyze the nature of counseling interactions by studying aspects such as mirroring, empathy, and reflective listening. A challenging aspect of this task is the lack of psychotherapy corpora. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset of high quality and low-quality counseling conversations collected from public web sources. We present a detailed description of the dataset collection process, including preprocessing, transcription, and the annotation of two counseling micro-skills: reflective listening and questions.

We then conduct a set of experiments where we explore the gender prediction task using single and combined modalities. Experimental results suggest that physiological and thermal information can be used to recognize gender at reasonable accuracy levels, which are comparable to the accuracy of current gender prediction systems. Furthermore, we show that the use of non-contact physiological measurements, such as thermography readings, can enhance current systems that are based on audio or visual input. This can be particularly useful for scenarios where non-contact approaches are preferred, i.e., when data is captured under noisy audiovisual conditions or when video or speech data are not available due to ethical considerations.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate these specific modalities to detect deceit. Several experiments are carried out in which we first select representative features for each modality, and then we analyze joint models that integrate several modalities. The experimental results show that the combination of features from different modalities significantly improves the detection of deceptive behaviors as compared to the use of one modality at a time. Moreover, the use of non-contact modalities proved to be comparable with and sometimes better than existing contact-based methods.

Indeed, language represents an invisible probe into the mind. It is the medium through which we express our deepest thoughts, our aspirations, our views, our feelings, our inner reality. From the beginning of artificial intelligence, researchers have sought to impart human like understanding to machines. As much of our language represents a form of self expression, capturing thoughts, beliefs, evaluations, opinions, and emotions which are not available for scrutiny by an outside observer, in the field of natural language, research involving these aspects has crystallized under the name of subjectivity and sentiment analysis. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification further divides subjective text into either positive, negative or neutral. In this thesis, I investigate techniques of generating tools and resources for subjectivity analysis that do not rely on an existing natural language processing infrastructure in a given language. This constraint is motivated by the fact that the vast majority of human languages are scarce from an electronic point of view: they lack basic tools such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, or basic resources such as electronic text, annotated corpora or lexica. This severely limits the implementation of techniques on par with those developed for English, and by applying methods that are lighter in the usage of text processing infrastructure, we are able to conduct multilingual subjectivity research in these languages as well. Since my aim is also to minimize the amount of manual work required to develop lexica or corpora in these languages, the techniques proposed employ a lever approach, where English often acts as the donor language (the fulcrum in a lever) and allows through a relatively minimal amount of effort to establish preliminary subjectivity research in a target language.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

I compare different classification systems and evaluate the performance of the automatic systems against the manual annotations. I also introduce a system that uses data collected from the social network Twitter.

While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Romanian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods applied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been looking at the ability of characters to carry sentiment information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of politeness and additional verbal modes embedded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These additional sources of information may not be available across all languages, yet, various articles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectivity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak English (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishes further every year, as more people across the globe gain Internet access.
 </br></br>
The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize the attendees with the subjectivity and sentiment research carried out on languages other than English in order to enable and promote cross-fertilization. Specifically, we will review work along three main directions. First, we will present methods where the resources and tools have been specifically developed for a given target language. In this category, we will also briefly overview the main methods that have been proposed for English, but which can be easily ported to other languages. Second, we will describe cross-lingual approaches, including several methods that have been proposed to leverage on the resources and tools available in English by using cross-lingual projections. Finally, third, we will show how the expression of opinions and polarity pervades language boundaries, and thus methods that holistically explore multiple languages at the same time can be effectively considered.",,,,,,,LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,

The semantic wildcard, denoted with #, acts in a manner similar with the lexical wildcard, but at semantic levels, enabling the retrieval of subsumed concepts. For instance, a search for <i>animal</i># will match any concept that is of type <i>animal</i>, including <i>dog</i>, <i>goat</i> and so forth, thereby going beyond the explicit knowledge stated in texts. This operator, together with a lexical locality operator that enables the retrieval of paragraphs rather than entire documents, have been both implemented in the IRSLO system and tested on requests of information run against an index of 130,000 documents.
